                This Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy (“Policy”) applies

                Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to
                us and we ask our users and their authorized agents to do the
                same. It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear
                notifications of alleged copyright infringement that comply with
                the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) of
                1998, the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright

                What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint
              </h3>
              <p>
                Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, consider whether
                the use could be considered fair use. Fair use states that brief
                excerpts of copyrighted material may, under certain
                circumstances, be quoted verbatim for purposes such as
                criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research, without the
                need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are
                reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an
                attorney before filing a notification with us.
              </p>
              <p>
                The DMCA requires you to provide your personal information in
                the copyright infringement notification. If you are concerned
                about the privacy of your personal information, you may wish to
                use an agent to report infringing material for you.
              </p>
              <h3 style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
                Notifications of infringement
              </h3>
              <p>
                If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you
                believe that any material available on our Services infringes
                your copyrights, then you may submit a written copyright
                infringement notification (“Notification”) using the contact
                details below pursuant to the DMCA. All such Notifications must
                comply with the DMCA requirements. You may refer to a DMCA
                takedown notice generator or other similar services to avoid
                making mistake and ensure compliance of your Notification.
              </p>
              <p>
                Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal
                process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity,
                and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these
                requirements, our response may include the removal or
                restriction of access to allegedly infringing material. We may
                also require a court order from a court of competent
                jurisdiction, as determined by us in our sole discretion, before
                we take any action.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an
                account in response to a Notification of alleged infringement,
                we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user
                with information concerning the removal or restriction of
                access.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
                portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves the right to take
                no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement
                notification if it fails to comply with all the requirements of
                the DMCA for such notifications.
              </p>
              <p>
                The process described in this Policy does not limit our ability
                to pursue any other remedies we may have to address suspected
                infringement.
              </p>
              <h3 style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>Changes and amendments</h3>
              <p>
                We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating
                to the Website and Services at any time, effective upon posting
                of an updated version of this Policy on the Website. When we do,
                we will post a notification on the main page of the Website. We
                encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed
                about our DMCA policy.
